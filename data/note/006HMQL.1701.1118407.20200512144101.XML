These reports should include the automatic and EFT payments processed by CQE as of yesterday afternoon.   They may also include some manual checks that were finished yesterday, any remaining manual checks will be finished by CQE today.  Those remaining manual checks will need to escalate overnight tonight, so I will request these reports again tomorrow to finish testing the manual checks.]]></NOTES>
